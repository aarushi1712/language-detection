# language-detection
In this project, we propose a language detection model that utilises a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with dropout regularisation to reduce overfitting. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of sentences from various languages, including English, French, Italian, Portuguese, German, Mandarin, Japanese, Marathi.
